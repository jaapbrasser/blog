I'm Jaap Brasser. I work on developer experience, automation, and infrastructure.

I write about how to ship software, reduce on-call pain, and get real value out of AI instead of hype. I care about clear docs and repeatable fixes. If something here helped you ship, copy it.

Iâ€™ve spent years in DevRel and automation roles. That means building tools, writing docs, and sitting with real engineers to see what actually blocks them. Most posts here come from something that broke in production or something I had to explain three times.

This site is my working log, so view it as that and if you have any feedback or questions feel free to reach out!
