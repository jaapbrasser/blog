summary: "Created a Codeberg account and researching the platform as a potential addition to my GitHub presence"
---
There’s growing momentum around European-owned developer infrastructure, and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) sits right at the center of it. Codeberg is a Forgejo-based software forge that positions itself as a democratic, community-driven, non-profit alternative to commercial code hosting platforms. For me it is a personal interest to see how open-source alternatives stack up against the commercial offerings and I'll migrate / share some of my projects there as I experiment with the platform. You can find my Codeberg profile [Codeberg - Jaap Brasser](https://codeberg.org/jaapbrasser).

I created a Codeberg account to evaluate it as a complement to my existing GitHub presence and started with their “[First Steps](https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/first-steps/)” documentation to understand onboarding, repository migration, and authentication flows. There's the community-maintained [Codeberg CLI](https://codeberg.org/cli/cli) adds the much desired CLI tooling.
